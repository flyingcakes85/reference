# A Guide to Packaging

This is the reference chapter for my workshop about packaging, hosted by FOSS United at Red Hat, Powai.

I've put main focus on Arch Linux, but its is _only_ an example. The core concepts apply to _ALL_ packaging systems; not just on Linux distributions, but even on macOS ([Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)) and Windows ([Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)). They can even be extended to language library resgistries like npm, pip, cargo etc.

This is presented in 6 parts:

- [What is packaging?](./what-is-packaging.md)
- [What exactly is in a package?](./what-exactly-is-in-a-package.md)
- [Lets look inside an Arch Linux package](./look-inside-arch-linux-package.md)
- [Packaging on Arch Linux](./packaging-on-arch.md)
- [Packaging the manual way](./packaging-the-manual-way.md)
- [Packaging: The broader look](./packaging-broader-look.md)
