# A Guide to Packaging
This is the reference chapter for my talk about packaging. I've put main focus on Arch Linux, but its is *only* an example. The core concepts apply to *ALL* packaging systems; not just on Linux distributions, but even on macOS ([Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)) and Windows ([Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)). They can even be extended to language library resgistries like npm, pip, cargo etc.
