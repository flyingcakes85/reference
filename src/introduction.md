# Introduction

This is the place where I dump technical content until my main [blog](https://snehit.dev/posts) gets revamped. (it'll never be revamped)

I tried a [redesign](https://redesign.snehit.dev) but its nowhere close to even acceptable.

So for the time being, I'll use this mdbook to organize my stuff.

Pull requests are welcome on [GitHub](https://github.com/flyingcakes85/reference) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/flyingcakes/reference).
